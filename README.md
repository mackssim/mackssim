- 👋 Hi, I’m @mackssim
- 👀 I’m interested in the easiest way to introduce yourself on GitHub is by creating a README in a repository about you! You can start here:
- 🌱 I’m currently learning angular, nodeJs
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on ...
- 📫 How to reach me ...

<!---
mackssim/mackssim is a ✨ special ✨ repository because its `README.md` (this file) appears on your GitHub profile.
You can click the Preview link to take a look at your changes.
